      "title": "Mevinolin: a highly potent competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and a cholesterol-lowering agent",
      "abstract": "Mevinolin, a fungal metabolite, was isolated from cultures of Aspergillus terreus. The structure and absolute configuration of mevinolini and its open acid form, mevinolinic acid, were determined by a combination of physical techniques. Mevinolin was shown to be 1,2,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-beta, delta-dihydroxy-2,6-dimethyl-8-(2-methyl-1-oxobutoxy)-1-naphthalene-hepatanoic acid delta-lactone. Mevinolin in the hydroxy-acid form, mevinolinic acid, is a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase [mevalonate: NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34]; its Ki of 0.6 nM can be compared to 1.4 nM for the hydroxy acid form of the previously described related inhibitor, ML-236B (compactin, 6-demethylmevinolin). In the rat, orally administered sodium mevinolinate was an active inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis in an acute assay (50% inhibitory dose = 46 microgram/kg). Furthermore, it was shown that mevinolin was an orally active cholesterol-lowering agent in the dog. Treatment of dogs for 3 weeks with mevinolin at 8 mg/kg per day resulted in a 29.3 +/- 2.5% lowering of plasma cholesterol.",

Most of the compounds are derivatives of diphlorethol penta-acetate and triphlorethol-A hepta-acetate. The majority turned out to be chlorinated and/or brominated. Only one iodinated substance, 2-iodophloroglucinol triacetate, was isolated. The structure of this derivative and the following compounds have been characterized previously: 2([D])-bromodiphlorethol penta-acetate, 3([A1])-bromodiphlorethol penta-acetate, 4([D])-bromo-diphlorethol penta-acetate, 4([D])-chlorodiphlorethol penta-acetate, 3([A1])-chlorotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 4([D])-bromotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate and 4([D])-chlorobisfucopentaphlorethol-A nonadeca-acetate. Ten halogenated phlorethols and two chlorinated fucophlorethols are described for the first time and characterized as their acetates: 2([B])-bromotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 2([D])-bromotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 2([B]), 2([D])-dibromotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 3([A1]), 5([A1])-dichlorotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 3([A1]), 4([D])-dichlorotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 3([A1])-chloro-4([D])-bromotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate. 2([B]), 4([D])-dichlorotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 2([D]), 3([A1])-dibromotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 3([A1])-bromo-2([D])-chlorotriphlorethol-A hepta-acetate, 2([D])-bromotetraphlorethol-C nona-acetate, 4([D])-chlorofucotriphlorethol-B dodeca-acetate and 4([D])-chlorobisfucotetraphlorethol-A heptadeca-acetate.",

      "abstract": "Uncultured bacteria represent a potentially rich source of new and useful natural products. Studying these natural products requires the development of effective yet straightforward methods to access the small-molecule chemical diversity produced by uncultured bacteria. In this study, DNA extracted directly from soil samples (environmental DNA, eDNA) was used to construct cosmid libraries in Escherichia coli, and these clones were then assayed for the production of antibiosis. A 13 open reading frame (ORF) biosynthetic gene cluster (feeA-M) found in one of the antibacterial active clones, CSLC-2, confers to E. coli the production of two new families of natural products that are derived from long chain N-acyltyrosines. The fee gene cluster and three families of the long chain acyl phenols derived from tyrosine (families 1, 2, and 3) are described.",
